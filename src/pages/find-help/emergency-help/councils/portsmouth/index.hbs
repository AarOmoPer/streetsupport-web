      <p>Tell Portsmouth Council you are homeless, or if you see someone sleeping rough in Portsmouth:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visit Housing options at the town hall - Guildhall Square, Portsmouth, PO1 2AX</li>
        <li>Call 023 9283 4989</li>
        <li>Email <a href="mailto:housing.options@portsmouthcc.gov.uk">housing.options@portsmouthcc.gov.uk</a></li>
      </ul>
      </p>If you come under a different council area, please visit your town hall or council website for information, or select from our <a href="/find-help/emergency-info/councils/">featured councils</a>.</p>

      <p>If you would like support through the process, or if you don't qualify as legally homeless, it is best to go to a <a href="/find-help/dropin/">local drop in centre</a>. There you can get advice on what housing options are available for you, and refer you into other services.</p>
