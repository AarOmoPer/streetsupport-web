        <li>Call 01202 315962 (24h messaging service)</li>

      <p>If you would like support through the process, or if you don't qualify as legally homeless, it is best to go to a <a href="/find-help/dropin/">local drop in centre</a>. There you can get advice on what housing options are available for you, and refer you into other services.</p>
