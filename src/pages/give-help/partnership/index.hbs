    	<h2 class="h2">What is needed?</h2>
      <p>Street Support is an independent not for profit that works to engage and connect a wide network of organisations and individuals around homelessness in the city. Our work is funded by donations from businesses and philanthropists that care about this issue and share our values.</p>
      <p>We are looking for businesses or organisations to sponsor us to develop and manage Street Support, based on the needs of people with experience of homelessness, and supporting over 40 organisations that provide services.</p>
      
      <h2 class="h2">Why is this important?</h2>
      <p>With homelessness number rising, and ongoing cuts to services, this central and neutral facilitation role is vital. Organisations resources are limited, and it isn’t easy for them to co-ordinate. Nobody else is doing this.</p>
      <p>This is about us all working together to change the situation - businesses, the council, charities, communities and individuals. We know what is being asked for and what is needed. With this funding we can provide effective solutions quickly.</p>
      <p>In order to quickly develop and improve the website, and to add more of the features that organisations are asking for, we need to pay skilled and experienced digital experts who all work at reduced rates.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">What are the benefits for your organisation?</h2>
      <p>This central resource is being used city-wide, and already making a significant difference. By sponsoring Street Support, you will be supporting over 40 charities and voluntary groups working to end homelessness.</p>
      <p>We acknowledge the support of our sponsors on the website, aswell as through social media and press.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">What else is in the pipeline?</h2>
      <p>We are currently working with people who are using the site and app to get their feedback and and make improvements. We are also looking at ways to automate matching of resources with needs, as we currently can't keep up with the enquiries and offers of help we recieve. </p>
      <p>We also have a list of requests that organisations feel would help them support people more effectively. Here are some of the features on our backlog&hellip;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Include and engage services from across Greater Manchester: £5,000</li>
        <li>Develop a public impact dashboard to increase transparency: £4,000</li>
        <li>Listings and review features for temporary accommodation: £5,000</li>
        <li>Develop a central skills and resources search function: £5,000</li>
        <li>User experience improvements to the current site and app: £4,000</li>
        <li>Download and print features for those without internet access: £2,000</li>
        <li>Map functionality for finding services locations: £2,000</li>
        <li>Wages for someone who has experienced homelessness to work on Street Support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And here are some of the things that have already been generously funded by local organisations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Launch The Manchester Homelessness Charter site: £10,000</li>
        <li>Apple and Android app versions of Street Support: £6,000</li>
      </ul>
