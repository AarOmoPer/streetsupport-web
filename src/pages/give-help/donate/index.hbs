        <p>By donating to the Big Change Fund you are supporting people who are homeless with the practical items they need to build new lives off the streets.</p>
        <p>This central fund brings together charities, organisations and people who want to end homelessness to use donations in the most effective way to support change.</p>
        <p>If everyone who lives, works or visits Manchester donates, together we can make a Big Change in our city!</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Why should I donate to the Big Change Fund?</h2>
        <p>Giving money to people begging on the street doesn’t help individuals move away from sleeping rough, or address the complicated range of reasons which made them homeless.</p>
        <p>Choosing to support the Big Change Fund is the most effective way to make sure your money is used in a way which directly helps people who are homeless change their lives.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">What happens to my donation?</h2>
        <p>Your donation joins the central Big Change funding pot which includes donations made by other kind hearted folk and organisations.</p>
        <p>We have a list of charities and organisations who have agreed to be Big Change partners and because these agencies work directly with people who are homeless, they make sure your donation gives maximum benefit.</p>
        <p>Individuals who are homeless can access the fund through these charities and organisations, and after working together to identify what items are needed to help build a new life, they send us an application form. Depending on the amount needed, there are two levels of fund requests to help an individual move away from sleeping rough.</p>

        <p>Individuals, who are homeless then receive important items, purchased using your donation, to help them take positive steps to staying off the street.  This might include paying for a deposit for a home, a training course to help improve job prospects and clothes for a job interview.
