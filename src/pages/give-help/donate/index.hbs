      <h2 class="h2">What is The Big Change Fund?</h2>
      <p>A coalition of Manchester charities and voluntary groups have teamed up to create a central fund to pay for practical items that homeless people need, so they can build new lives off the streets.</p>
      <a class="btn btn--brand-d" href="http://campaign.justgiving.com/charity/forevermanchester/bigchangemcr"><span class="btn__text">Donate to the Big Change Fund</span></a>

      <h2 class="h2">Where will my money go?</h2>
      <p>Money donated to the fund is distributed to individuals who are homeless - paying for deposits, training courses, clothes for a job interview, furnishing a new flat, purchasing crockery, pots and pans and bed linen, and transport to travel to new accommodation.</p>
      <p>Just Giving charge a 5% admin fee, and Forever Manchester charge 10% to manage the fund, the rest goes directly to individuals experiencing homelessness.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Why is this better than giving money on the streets?</h2>
      <p>Those who provide support to rough sleepers advise that giving money to people who are begging isn't an effective way to support them to move them away from the streets. By giving money via this network of experts, you can be sure that your donation will go directly to meet genuine needs, and make a real difference. To address the complicated range of problems which made them homeless, including mental health issues and drug and alcohol addiction, people experiencing homelessness need long term support.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">What other projects could i donate to?</h2>
      <p>There are many fantastic charities in Manchester providing support to homeless people. You can find out more about all these charities and grassroots groups on our <a href="/find-help/all-service-providers/">organisations list</a>. Here are just a few examples of organisations that currently need donations to run their services: <a href="http://www.boothcentre.org.uk/donate.html">The Booth Centre</a>, <a href="http://www.mustardtree.org.uk/donate/donate-money/">Mustard Tree</a>, <a href="http://www.cornerstonecds.org.uk/online-donation">Cornerstone</a>.</p>
