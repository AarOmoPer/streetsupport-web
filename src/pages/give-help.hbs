          <p>One bright day in the near future, this page will be your launchpad to effective action.</p>
          <p>You’ll see posts from local charities and voluntary groups, letting you know how you can make the biggest difference to them and the homeless people they support.</p>
          <p>You’ll be able to find your way to play your part.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, you can help rough sleepers in Manchester get off, and stay off the streets, through the 'Big Change Manchester' campaign.</p>
