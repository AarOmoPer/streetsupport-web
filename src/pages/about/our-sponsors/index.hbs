            <p>We rely on grants and donations to develop and support this network, so that more people experiencing homelessness can get the help they need. With the help of our sponsors and partners, we are able to continue this work - co-creating online tools, facilitating workshops, events and conversations, enabling joined up thinking that addresses the gaps and helps the network work more effectively together. Here are some of the organisations that make our work possible...</p>

          <h2 class="h2"><a href="https://donate.humanappeal.org.uk/">Human Appeal</a></h2>
          <p>Human Appeal have supported us to rollout Street Support to other areas across Greater Manchester. With their grant we were able to refactor streetsupport.net to handle new locations outside of the city, with results based on postcode. We were also able to engage and support more organisations to post their needs, so that donations made during ramandan were more effective.</p>

          <p>The Holy Name Church have supported us with developing the Manchester Homelessness Charter section of the website as well as helping to develop the app versions of Street Support Network. They have also helped us add new features to the website, so that more people can 'Find Help' and 'Give Help' in Manchester.</p>

          <p>With a donation from the GM Mayor Fund, we were able to find and map many new organisations in other areas of GM, so that more people are able to find help wherever they are. This also enables the GM homelessness action network to co-ordinate, identify gaps and reduce duplication.</p>
