      <p>Street Support is an independent organisation that is a trusted source of information on homelessness in our featured cities. In order to maintain a good standard of information, we only list organisations that match our values.</p>

      <p>Each city has a panel that decides who to include on Street Support. In Manchester, our guidelines are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Incorporate the Vision and the Values embodied in the <a href="https://charter.streetsupport.net/">Manchester Homelessness Charter</a></li>
        <li>Commit to working together by contributing to and adhering to the aims of the Manchester Homelessness Partnership</li>
        <li>Ensure safeguarding standards are met, and the needs of a wider community are respected</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="h2">Connecting with networks near you</h2>
      <p>Organisations in and around Manchester should join <a href="/manchester/cor/">Coalition of Relief</a>, to work towards and achieve the best practice benchmark.</p>
      <p>If you are an organisation from another city, please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> and we will help connect you with your local network.</p>
