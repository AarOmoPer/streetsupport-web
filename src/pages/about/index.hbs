      <p>Street Support is a central digital hub, uniting all the charities and voluntary groups that support homeless people with all those whoâ€™d like to help. We have been live in Manchester UK since early 2016, and currently developing networks in other cities, starting with Leeds.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use our <a href="/find-help/">Find Help</a> section to find local services, so that someone experiencing homelessness can get the help they need.</li>
        <li>Use our <a href="/give-help/">Give Help</a> section to find out what items, money or people local homelessness organisations currently need - simple and effective ways to take action.</li>
        <li>Through <a href="https://charter.streetsupport.net">Manchester Homelessness Charter</a> section you can support a city-wide partnership of organisations, service providers and businesses to end homelessness in Manchester.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This allows the network to collaborate, co-ordinate and provide better support for people experiencing homelessness. Many small, co-ordinated actions add up to a big difference to homeless people in the city.</p>
      <p>Whoever you are, and however you can, please get involved. If you would like to stay informed, you can get regular updates from Street Support by adding your details to the <a href="/join-street-support/">Street Support supporters list here.</a></p>

      <h2 class="h2">About us</h2>
      <p>We are a collective of digital experts in Manchester, working closely alongside people who are homeless and the organisations that support them. We use research, human centered design and creative technology to build online tools that make it easier for people experiencing homelessness to get the help they need.</p>
      <p>We started the project in October 2015 with a small core team of 3, and have developed the site with the help of our network of digital experts. You can read more about the team behind Street Support here: <a href="about-our-team/">About our team</a>.</p>
      <p>We run on a not for profit basis (including a lot of hours worked for free!). We were originally set up as a Ltd company, and are currently transferring to official not for profit status.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">What next?</h2>
      <p>There are many more features that have been requested for Street Support, and we are continually looking to improve the experience based on user feedback.</p>
      <p>Longer term, we want to offer these tools to other locations, and eventually create a wide Street Support Network accross the UK and beyond.</p>
      <p>We have been funded so far by donations from local philanthropists and a loan from KeyFund. In order to continue to develop and improve this central resource for Manchester, we are looking for businesses to sponsor us as part of their CSR. If you support our mission to End Homelessness and are interested in becoming a Street Support partner, please contact us at <a href="mailto:partnership@streetsupport.net">partnership@streetsupport.net</a>.</p>
