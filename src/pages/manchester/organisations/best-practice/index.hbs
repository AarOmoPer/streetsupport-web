      <p>Do you run, or plan to offer, services which support people who are homeless? By following best practice, your organisation, services and volunteers will make a bigger impact on ending homelessness.</p>
      <p>These pages help you develop, and be recognised for, your quality. This will benefit the people you are supporting, and your volunteers. For example, itâ€™s important that all volunteers have the right support and training to work with vulnerable people, with a range of needs.</p>
