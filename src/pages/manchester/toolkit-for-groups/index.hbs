      <p>We work to support and connect many amazing local voluntary organisations, both charities and grassroots groups. Many volunteers offer incredible kindness and generosity to support people who are experiencing homelessness.</p>
      <p>Working with vulnerable adults, some with complex needs, there is a lot to consider when trying to help - from safeguarding of volunteers and those you aim to help, to training, and knowledge about what other support is available (such as the Big Change fund). It is essential that people link into services who can offer advice and long term support to move away from homelessness.</p>
      <p>If you are considering doing something to help, it is important to start with a really good understanding of the services that already exist, and of what is really needed. You can find out more about existing services and what help is needed in our <a href="/find-help/">Find Help</a> and <a href="/give-help/">Give Help</a> sections.</p>
      <p>Together with Coffee4Craig and a network of other groups in the city, we have put together some guidance, tools, training and an award scheme to help community led groups to set up and evolve in a way that is safe and effective for everyone involved. You can also join Coalition of Relief (COR), a network of Manchester based grassroots organisation. We hope that you find this useful.</p>
