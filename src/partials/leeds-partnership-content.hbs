      <h2 class="h2">Help us end homelessness in Leeds</h2>
      <p>Street Support is an independent not for profit that connects the homeless community who need help, with organisations in the city who provide support.  Our website is the ONE place to go to find out about Leeds homelessness, and more importantly, DO SOMETHING TO HELP.</p>
      <p>Our work is funded by donations from local businesses and philanthropists that care about this issue and share our values.  To continue to develop Street Support, and manage our day to day operations, we need further financial support, and we are looking to local businesses or organisations for help.</p>
      
      <h2 class="h2">Why do we need your help?</h2>
      <p>There are amazing services to help people who are homeless in Leeds, but it is not easy for the general public to know what support is available, and what is needed. Street Support provides the solution.</p>
      <p>We know what organisations need, to improve their service, and what the homeless community need to improve their situation.  We just need funding to enable us to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connect and support organisations in Leeds, working towards a Homelessness Charter.</li>
        <li>Research and communicate what is currently needed, connecting to available resources and volunteers.</li>
        <li>Develop and improve the website and app, co-producing new features with the homeless community.</li>
        <li>Pay skilled and experienced digital experts (who all work at reduced rates).</li>
        <li>Inspire and inform those that might be able to help, through information and stories.</li> 
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h2">How you can help</h2>
